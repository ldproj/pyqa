## What we have already done

* ### Selected a folder _(also known as a __directory__)_

    this is where we will be working from

* ### Started Visual Studio Code _(also known as __VS CODE__)_

    We launched it in our folder _(__directory__)_

    we could have also done the same by ___opening VS Code___ and then from the menu command, ___File > Open Folder___ and then browsing to our directory

* ### Opened the Terminal in _VS Code_

  using the menu command
__View > Terminal__

    __Note:__ We can still open an __external Shell__ with
    keyboard shortcut  $Ctrl+Shift+C$

* ### Launched __JupyterLab__

    by executing the following command in the terminal

    ```bash
        jupyter lab
    ```

    __Note:__ "Sometimes" JupyterLab is also referred to as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). This is the collective name given by the makers of jupyterLab that also make other interactive computing software for other programming languages of which Python is one.
