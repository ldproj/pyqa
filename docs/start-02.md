# What we have already done

* ## Opened our ___Project___ in _Jupyter_ using the browser

    we copied the _url_ in the ___terminal print out___ which _looks similar_ to the following

```javascript
    'http://localhost:8888/?token=bdcff1bdbe6a3a723e20743415bc0a80263e798a4d1c23c4'
```

* ## Selected a ___Launcher___ for our project

    jupyter gives us several options, they are listed as icons.

    We have gone for the __Notebook__ ___Python___ Launcher

* ## Selected a ___Cell___ to write our first line of code

  we can add a _comment_ to the code within the cell by starting the line with a <kbd>#</kbd>

* ## ___Run___ the code in the selected cell

    using keyboard shortcut $Shift+Enter$

    and got immediate feedback

* ## Navigated cells

    using the <kbd> up ↑ </kbd> or <kbd>down ↓</kbd> keys on the keyboard

* ## Re-run cells

  re-selecting the cell and $Shift+Enter$
  re-runs the cell. We do this after we have edited a cell that has already been run to re-evaluate the changes
