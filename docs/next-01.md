# __Fun with Py__

## Intro

* ### Add a new Notebook Launcher to the project

* ### Rename the notebooke to "exercise-01"

* ### copy the following code into the first cell and __run it__

```python
    #import Exercise from exercises module
    from src.exercises import Exercise

    #create exercise one
    exercise_one = Exercise(1)
```

* ### move to the next cell

*  ### copy the following line of code into the cell

```python
    #start the exercise
    exercise_one.next()
```

* ### Before you run it think about what the previous lines of code are doing

* ### Proceed and complete the exercises as prompted

    You can step to through the exercises by calling _next()_ again

    The following line of code may also be useful

```python
    exercise_one.back()
```
